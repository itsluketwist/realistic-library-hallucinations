## *about*

Just some prototyping and initial code for various code-hallucinations projects!

## *structure*

todo

- `data/` - The data used in the project.
- `output/` - The generated results.
- `src/` - The main project code.

## *installation*

The code requires Python 3.11 or later to run.
Ensure you have it installed with the command below, otherwise download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```shell
python --version
```

Now clone the repository code:

```shell
git clone **redacted**
```

Once cloned, install the requirements locally in a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv .venv

. .venv/bin/activate

pip install .
```

## *usage*

todo

## *development*

We use a few extra processes to ensure the code maintains a high quality.
First clone the project and create a virtual environment - as described above.
Now install the editable version of the project, with the development dependencies.

```shell
pip install --editable ".[dev]"
```

### *tests*

This project includes unit tests to ensure correct functionality.
Use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to run the tests with:

```shell
pytest tests
```

### *linting*

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to lint the code, run it using:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### *dependencies*

We use [`uv`](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) for dependency management.
First add new dependencies to `requirements.in`.
Then version lock with [`uv`](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) using:

```shell
uv pip compile requirements.in --output-file requirements.txt --upgrade
```
