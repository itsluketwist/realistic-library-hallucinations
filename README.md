## *about*

Just some prototyping and initial code for various code-hallucinations projects!

## *installation*

The code requires Python 3.11 or later to run.
Ensure you have it installed with the command below, otherwise download and install it from
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```shell
python --version
```

Now clone the repository code:

```shell
git clone **redacted**
```

Once cloned, install the requirements locally in a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv .venv

. .venv/bin/activate

pip install .
```

## *usage*

After [*installation*](#installation), there are 2 ways to run the experiment code.
The easiest of which is via the the [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) notebook, which fully describes
each experiment and provides the methods to run them.

You can also use the `run` command from your terminal - this is likely best if you want to
reproduce the experiments on an external server or in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
container.

```shell
run --dataset-file data/example.json
```

All other non-experiment code that likely only needed to be ran a single time is explained in,
and can be interfaced with, via it's corresponding Jupyter notebook.
These notebooks are contained in the [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) directory, and are described in the
[*structure*](#structure) section.

## *structure*

todo

- [`data/`](data/) - The data used in the project.
- [`output/`](output/) - The generated results.
- [`src/`](src/) - The main project code.

## *development*

We use a few extra processes to ensure the code maintains a high quality.
First clone the project and create a virtual environment - as described above.
Now install the editable version of the project, with the development dependencies.

```shell
pip install --editable ".[dev]"
```

### *tests*

This project includes unit tests to ensure correct functionality.
Use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to run the tests with:

```shell
pytest tests
```

### *linting*

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to lint the code, run it using:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### *dependencies*

We use [`uv`](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) for dependency management.
First add new dependencies to `requirements.in`.
Then version lock with [`uv`](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) using:

```shell
uv pip compile requirements.in --output-file requirements.txt --upgrade
```
